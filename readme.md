# Piano Jam 
Piano Jam is a collaborative site where people can come together and enjoy playing the piano. No matter where you are, you can all interact with the piano and create music. In addition to networking music and creativity, Piano Jam adds color to your tunes with flashing colored lights in the background. These are strobing lights, so be careful if you have epilepsy! In order to use this site, clone the repo and connect it to a webserver (edit file: vuejavascript.js ) or run it in browser over your local network (node webSocketServer.js) !
